# Aircraft Engines Analysis using Gradient Boosting

## Project Overview
This project analyzes aircraft engine data to identify potential engine failures using Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) modeling. The dataset includes details about engine manufacture, model, power, fuel injection type, and propeller type. The goal is to classify whether an engine has a failure risk based on its model type and visualize various aspects of the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset `aircraft_engines.csv` contains the following columns:
- **engine_manufacture**: Name of the engine manufacturer
- **engine_model**: Model of the engine
- **power**: Power output of the engine
- **power_type**: Type of power generated by the engine
- **fuel_injection_type**: Type of fuel injection used
- **propeller_type**: Type of propeller associated with the engine
- **last_changed_date**: The last date when the engine data was updated

## Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary libraries in R:
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("gbm")
```

## Steps in Analysis
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Read the dataset into R using `read.csv()`.
- Display dataset structure using `str()`.
- Generate summary statistics using `summary()`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Created a binary outcome variable `engine_failure`, where engines of model `MP14-PXDK` are considered failures.
- Grouped certain engine models into a categorical variable `engine_model_grouped`.
- Split the dataset into **75% training** and **25% testing**.

### 3. Model Training with Gradient Boosting
- Defined a formula for classification: `engine_failure ~ engine_model_grouped`.
- Trained a Gradient Boosting Model (`gbm`) for binary classification using:
  - **100 trees**
  - **Interaction depth of 3**
  - **Shrinkage of 0.1**
- Predictions were generated on the test set.

### 4. Data Visualization
The following visualizations were created using `ggplot2`:
- **Engine Manufacture vs. Engine Model**: A stacked bar plot showing the distribution of engine models per manufacturer.
- **Fuel Injection Type Distribution**: A bar plot displaying the frequency of different fuel injection types.
- **Power vs. Last Changed Date**: A scatter plot showing power variations over time.
- **Propeller Type vs. Engine Model (Percentage)**: A proportional bar chart representing propeller types for different engine models.
- **Propeller Type vs. Engine Model**: A stacked bar chart showing the count of propeller types by engine model.

## Steps for Execution
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Ensure you have access to the dataset and script.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Use the R commands provided in the Requirements section.
3. **Load and Explore Data**: Run the dataset loading and exploratory analysis steps.
4. **Preprocess Data**: Convert categorical variables, create binary outcome variables, and split the dataset.
5. **Train the Model**: Run the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model as per the script.
6. **Make Predictions**: Evaluate test set predictions and interpret results.
7. **Visualize Data**: Generate the plots using `ggplot2`.

## Running the Code
To execute the project, run the following R script:
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gbm)

# Read dataset
aircraft_engines <- read.csv("~/Documents/R Programs/aircraft_engines.csv")

# Run Gradient Boosting Model
# (Complete script as mentioned in project)
```

## Output
The output includes:
1. Engine failure predictions for the test dataset.
2. Various visualizations providing insights into engine specifications and failure trends.
